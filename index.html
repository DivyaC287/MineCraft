            1. The first version of Minecraft (known as Cave Game at the time) was created in <b>six days</b>. Six. 10 May 2009 to 16 May 2009.

            2. Minecraft was <b>created by Swedish designer and programmer Markus Persson</b> (known as "Notch" by fans). He wanted Minecraft to allow exploration of the 
            virtual world that was free and organic, for his new company, Mojang AB.

            3. The full version of Minecraft was completed on <b>18 November 2011</b>, after which it was first released and made known to the world.

            4. What is known as Minecraft was originally called <b>Cave Game</b>, then Minecraft: Order of the Stone, before simply Minecraft.

            5. The sounds that <b>Ghasts make comes from a sleeping cat</b>. Namely, Minecraft's music producer Daniel <b>'C418' Rosenfeld's cat</b>, who was accidentally recorded 
            waking from sleep.

            6. Minecraft was inspired by other known computer games, such as Dungeon Keeper, RollerCoaster Tycoon, Infiniminer and Dwarf Fortress.
            <h2> Things That Changed Over The Years </h2>
            The Minecraft originally created in <b>2009</b> has seen some unexpected changes. Some original intentions didn't go to plan, but we think you'd find them quite 
            interesting to know nonetheless.

            7. A creeper was initially supposed to be a <b>pig</b>. Persson switched the height and length of a <b>creeper</b> by mistake when inputting the code.

            8. The original Enderman had <b>green eyes</b>. The mobs from the land of Ender now have purple eyes and, still, only attack when aggravated by a player.

            9. The crafting table in Minecraft, where players create a number of items and blocks, was formerly called <b>workbench</b>.

            10. There was once going to be a <b>Sky Dimension in Minecraft</b>, in addition to the others: The End, Far Lands, Overworld, Void, Outer End and The Nether. 
            Before the idea was scrapped, it was going to be the opposite of The Nether.

            11. Once in every <b>10,000 times</b> you play Minecraft, the menu at the start will <b>flash a misspelling of its name</b> - you'll see "Minceraft" instead of "Minecraft".

            12. 1 block is 1 cubic metre (the size of a cube that is 1 metre long, 1 metre wide and 1 metre high).

            13. Persson's avatar in the game is the only one who <b>drops an apple</b> when he dies.

            14. Creepers are afraid of <b>ocelots</b> (wild cat mobs which are passive, but attack chickens in Minecraft).

            15. Microsoft purchased Minecraft for <b>2.5 billion dollars</b> (1.9 billion pounds) in 2014.

            16. Normally, the hostile zombie mobs burn during the day. The exception to this is if they are in a cobweb - a type of block which <b>slows down movement</b>.

            17. Many think Minecraft is infinite, and that players can keep venturing further and further out in their world. However, if a player does so, they will 
            eventually arrive at the "World Boundary", where they won't be able to go any further.
